			This changes the way the item break mechanics work entirely.<br>
			Only items which are on the first item page can be set to have a chance to crack, and when they do they will turn into the corresponding item in the extended item page (Item ID + 64).<br>
			You can just copy/paste an item from the first page to the spot in the extended page to make sure it breaks properly, but this also lets you do things like having special broken icons for items or reduced stats.<br>
			Similarly, extended items have a Broken check box, and if this is checked the item can be repaired which will turn it into the corresponding item on the first page (Item ID + 64).<br>
			The matching item need not have a chance to break, allowing for the option to have a broken item which can be permanently repaired to a new item.<br><br>

			Also note that the icon for item 64 is used as the 'Remove' icon in the equip screens, so do not use that slot as an item.</p>

		    <h1>Scripting</h1>
                    <div class="info"><big>&#x1F6C8;</big> Click and drag on empty space to move the view. Click to select/edit and click+drag to move nodes.<br>

			The triangular 'Start' node indicates the beginning of the script. The code will follow the graph along the lines of connected nodes, generally just from left to right.<br>

			A square node just performs an action and moves onto the next node, there will be one line from the left in and one line from the right out in a straight horizontal line.<br>

			A diamond node represents a check/choice. This type of node will have one line in on the left, but two (or maybe more) out on the right; one continuing on the same line and the rest moving down to lower lines. Each will be labeled with the type of result (Equal, Not equal, etc)<br>

			The circular 'End' nodes indicate the script should finish here. Any node which isn't connected on the right will automatically get an 'End' attached when saving.

			The selected node and its outputs will be highlighted in blue. Right clicking or double clicking a node will open it for editing options.<br>

			With a node selected, press the left/right keys to move along connected nodes. If a node has multiple outs, use up/down to follow the other branch.<br>

			A selected node will show a blue square on the right side, click and dragging from this point will allow it to be reconnected to another node.

			Press <code>z</code> to change the zoom level, and expand or maximize the window for easier editing.

                    <h3>Script</h3>
                    <p>Click and edit or use the <code>Plus</code> or <code>Minus</code> buttons to select an script for editing.</p>

                    <h3>Script Set</h3>
                    <p>Click and edit or use the <code>Plus</code> or <code>Minus</code> buttons to select an script set for editing.<br>
			Each script set handles a completely different set of tasks with different types of nodes available.<br><br>
			Currently the sets are: 0 - Dialogue/NPC Interaction, 1 - End of Battle, 2 - Battle Exits
			</p>


		    <h3>Actions</h3>
		    <p>A list of available action nodes. Click and drag to add a new node of that type, or double click to add to the middle of the screen.<br>
			The <code>?</code> button will give an explanation of that node if available.<br>
			The node will need to be connected from the left before it can be reached.


		    <h3>Checks</h3>
		    <p>A list of available check/choice nodes. Click and drag to add a new node of that type, or double click to add to the middle of the screen.<br>
			The <code>?</code> button will give an explanation of that node if available.<br>
			The node will need to be connected from the left before it can be reached, and connected on the right to as many nodes as there are outcomes (almost always just 2, except in battle exits).


		    <h3>Add End</h3>
		    <p>Creates a cirular 'End' note in the center of the editing area.<br>
			Not usually necessary, since ends are added automatically when saving.</p>

		    <h3>Fill Ends</h3>
		    <p>Creates a cirular 'End' note connected to the right of every node that isn't an end and doesn't have a connection to the right.<br>
			Not usually necessary, since this is done automatically when saving, but can be useful for seeing while in the middle of editing if you don't want to save yet.</p>

		    <h3>Previous Node</h3>
		    <p>With a node selected, moves back to the node connected to the left.<br>
			Same as pressing up/left on the keyboard.</p>	

		    <h3>Follow Branch</h3>
		    <p>With a node selected that has more than one output to the right, moves to the lower node.<br>
			Same as pressing down on the keyboard.</p>


		    <h3>Search</h3>
		    <p>Brings up a dialog which allows you to search for any node which displays a particular message.</p>

		    <h3>Clear All</h3>
		    <p>Removes all nodes from the current script except for the start. Only use this if you know what you are doing and are totally rebuilding a section!</p>		    	

		    <h3>Disconnect</h3>
		    <p>When editing a node, removes all connections to and from the selected node.<br>
			<div class="notice" id="expand-rom"><big>&#9888;</big>Be careful when disconnecting nodes either this way or by dragging new connections. Any unreachable nodes that don't have a connection from the left will be lost when saving.</div>
			</p>

		    <h3>Remove</h3>
		    <p>When editing a node, deletes the selected node.<br>
			Make sure to reconnect the adjacent nodes if deleted from the middle of a line.<br>
			Also accessible via the <code>Delete</code> key.
